Description: The biodatatext package is a tool allowing to extract information
    from electronic medical records.
    After patient consent, his data collected into hospital might be used for
    biomedical research. But this information is often described in free text
    documents, that is difficult to use for data analysis. To retrieve this
    data, it should requires manual reading, which is a very time consuming 
    task.
    In order to facilitate this work, the biodatatext package allows to
    automatically extract the desired information from the texts. Extraction
    concerns quantitative and qualitative variables, targeted with the help of 
    the user who needs to provide keywords and specify what type of variable it
    corresponds to (for example a value linked to a unit, a score, a boolean, a
    phenotypic description, ...).
